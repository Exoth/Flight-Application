This is an experimental API of flight search.

The path is /flights.json
The method is GET.

Expected mandatory params are:

from, to - 3-letter IATA codes of airports.
departure - date of departure in YY-MM-DD format.

Optional params are:

stopover - 3-letter IATA code of a stopover between 'from' and 'to' points.
           Difference between departure time of the second part and arrival time of the first part must be from an hour to a day.
price - max total price of all flights of the travel. So if there's a stopover, then it's a sum of prices of two parts of the travel.
travel_time - max total travel time.
              So if there's a stopover, then it's the difference between arrival time of the second part and departure time of the first part.

Example of expected output in JSON:

[{"price":"760.0","flights":[{"arrival":"2012-06-30T04:35:00Z","departure":"2012-06-30T02:49:00Z","from":"BNS","to":"EOE"},{"arrival":"2012-07-02T00:00:00Z","departure":"2012-07-01T00:00:00Z","from":"EOE","to":"DKC"}]}]

Where "price" is already calculated total price of all parts of the travel.

There's a task to create 100k random flights (IATA airport codes are from AAA to CCC to reduce amount of airports): rake demo:generate
